Stormrider



Self / Combustion
Engines roaring burning up the wheels

Self / Destruction
Hitting the gas, intending to kill

Insane / Confusion
The highway to hell is closer to me

Fearless / Conduction
holding the power of countless beasts



[Chorus]

Stormrider
Breathing the fire of burning bones

Stormrider
A killer's desire, from the great evil ones



Flesh / And steel
Mixing in one by the heat of hell

Blood / As I feel
Boiling in my veins fucking up my skin

Gods / of speed
Keep me alive while i break the limits

Adrenaline / is the seed
that send me beyond the three hundred speed

[Chorus]
